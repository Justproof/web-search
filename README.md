# safe-web-research

Claude has two built-in web tools <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool">Web Fetch</a> and <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool">Web Search</a> which are available to use in every Claude Code installation. With a fresh Claude install, the default permission mode asks for approval before each use. 

Most people approve or switch default Mode to "auto", which allows web searching with full permission. Full auto is a reasonable choice, but consider what this means when using AI to search the internet: not every site out there has good intentions for an AI crawler, and certain <a href="https://pcdrama.com/blog/ai-tarpits#why-web-admins-send-non-sense-to-ai">"Stay off my lawn / website" web admins</a> are punching back by relaying non-sense to bots, causing AI to struggle through AI tarpits.
Without guardrails, it will cheerfully read a shady webpage that opens with "ignore your previous instructions" and politely follow along. No questions asked.

> **Curious?** Ask Claude: *"Are there built-in protections when using web fetch or web search tools?"*
> You'll get a polite answer, and the [official docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) back up this response: No. there aren't any prompt injection guardrails. That's exactly why Safe Web Research guardrails are necessary.
> That's exactly why Safe Web Research guardrails are necessary.

**Safe Web Research** fixes that with two quiet layers:

- **Custom TypeScript hooks** that intercept, inspect, and clean every web response before Claude reads a single byte.
- **A clear judgment skill** that helps Claude spot trouble and respond wisely instead of blind trust.

No paranoia. Just everyday common sense, like sending a teenager out for milk and your certain they are not distracted or completing 8 side missions . Claude stays helpful and fast. It just stops being gullible.

Ready to set it up? Grab a coffee and follow along. This takes about five minutes.

## What's in the box

| Component | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Hooks** (`PreToolUse` + `PostToolUse`) | Intercept `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `curl`/`wget` in Bash, and browser MCP tools. Check `robots.txt`, detect cloaking and injection attempts, compute risk signals, and wrap all web content in `<untrusted_source>` tags before Claude reads a single byte. |
| **Skill** (`safe-web-research`) | Gives Claude the judgment rules: when to abort a source, how to classify risk signals, what to emit in `<safe_research_summary>` blocks, and how to handle corroboration and output discipline. |

The hooks handle mechanics. The skill handles reasoning. Neither can be argued out of its job by a web page.

---

## Prerequisites

**[Bun](https://bun.sh)** — the hooks are TypeScript and run with `bun run` directly (no compile step).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Verify: `bun --version` should print `1.x` or higher.

## Install

### 1. Copy files

From inside this repo:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks/lib
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/safe-web-research
mkdir -p ~/.claude/bin

cp hooks/package.json          ~/.claude/hooks/package.json
cp hooks/web-fetch-pre.ts      ~/.claude/hooks/web-fetch-pre.ts
cp hooks/web-fetch-post.ts     ~/.claude/hooks/web-fetch-post.ts
cp hooks/lib/bash-matcher.ts   ~/.claude/hooks/lib/bash-matcher.ts
cp hooks/lib/refetch.ts        ~/.claude/hooks/lib/refetch.ts
cp hooks/lib/sanitise.ts       ~/.claude/hooks/lib/sanitise.ts
cp hooks/lib/signals.ts        ~/.claude/hooks/lib/signals.ts
cp hooks/lib/state.ts          ~/.claude/hooks/lib/state.ts
cp skills/safe-web-research/SKILL.md        ~/.claude/skills/safe-web-research/SKILL.md
cp skills/safe-web-research/risk-tiers.json ~/.claude/skills/safe-web-research/risk-tiers.json
cp bin/claude-sanitize ~/.claude/bin/claude-sanitize
chmod +x ~/.claude/bin/claude-sanitize
```

Or as a one-liner from the parent directory:

```bash
cp -r hooks/. ~/.claude/hooks/ && \
cp -r skills/. ~/.claude/skills/ && \
cp bin/claude-sanitize ~/.claude/bin/ && \
chmod +x ~/.claude/bin/claude-sanitize
```

### 2. Install the npm dependency

```bash
cd ~/.claude/hooks && bun install
```

This installs `shell-quote` for safe Bash command parsing. No build step needed.

### 3. Register hooks in Claude Code settings

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (merge with any existing `hooks` block):

```json
{
    "hooks": {
        "PreToolUse": [
            {
                "matcher": "WebFetch|WebSearch|Bash|mcp__claude-in-chrome__(navigate|read_page|get_page_text|read_network_requests)|mcp__brightdata__.*",
                "hooks": [
                    {
                        "type": "command",
                        "command": "$HOME/.bun/bin/bun run $HOME/.claude/hooks/web-fetch-pre.ts",
                        "timeout": 5000
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "PostToolUse": [
            {
                "matcher": "WebFetch|WebSearch|mcp__claude-in-chrome__(navigate|read_page|get_page_text|read_network_requests)|mcp__brightdata__.*",
                "hooks": [
                    {
                        "type": "command",
                        "command": "$HOME/.bun/bin/bun run $HOME/.claude/hooks/web-fetch-post.ts",
                        "timeout": 8000
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

`PreToolUse` includes `Bash` so `curl`/`wget` calls get rewritten to pipe through `claude-sanitize`. `PostToolUse` covers structured web tool responses only.

Hooks are fail-open — a hook crash never blocks Claude Code.

### 4. Add the skill reference to your CLAUDE.md

Add this to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Web Research Protocol

Web research safety is handled by the Safe Web Research skill (`~/.claude/skills/safe-web-research/SKILL.md`). The hook (`~/.claude/hooks/web-fetch-pre.ts` + `web-fetch-post.ts`) wraps every web fetch in `<untrusted_source>`; the skill carries the abort, corroboration, and reporting rules.
```

### 5. Verify

Start a fresh Claude Code session:

```
fetch https://example.com and summarize it
```

You should see the response wrapped in `<untrusted_source url="https://example.com" sanitiser_version="1.0.0" ...>` tags. Or check the state database directly:

```bash
~/.claude/bin/claude-sanitize status
```

---

## How it works

Every web fetch goes through two checkpoints:

**Pre-hook** — before the request:
- URL-level checks: homoglyphs, non-ASCII hostnames, embedded credentials, zero-width chars
- `robots.txt` fetch and cache (24h TTL); disallowed AI user-agents skip the fetch entirely
- Bash command rewriting: `curl`/`wget` pipes get redirected through `claude-sanitize`

**Post-hook** — after the response:
- Strips scripts, hidden elements, event handlers, and zero-width characters (in `enforce` mode)
- Computes risk signals (injection phrases, cloaking, oversized responses, tarpit patterns)
- Runs a parallel refetch to detect cloaking (the page serving different content to Claude than to a browser)
- Wraps everything in `<untrusted_source>` with signal metadata

**Skill** — when Claude reads the result:
- Abort rules fire before any analysis, quoting, or downstream actions
- Per-source `<safe_research_summary>` blocks for every cited URL
- Aborted sources have zero downstream gravity — they don't influence tool selection, code generation, or package recommendations

---

## Risk signals

**Critical** (any one = abort):

- `injection_phrase` — matches curated prompt-injection patterns
- `cloaking_suspected` — parallel refetch diverged from the agent's fetch
- `oversized_response` — above size cap
- `repeating_substring_ratio_high` — Markov-style repetition (poisoning / honeypot)
- `url_cardinality_explosion` — tarpit signature

**Elevated** (three or more = abort):

- `zero_width_chars`
- `hidden_content_ratio_high`
- `redirect_chain_long` (> 5 hops)
- `content_type_mismatch`
- `near_duplicate_to_session`

Tier assignments live in `skills/safe-web-research/risk-tiers.json` and can be overridden via the SQLite config.

---

## Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `log` (default) | Computes signals and wraps content, but passes the **original** bytes through. Good for a soak period to understand signal frequency before enabling stripping. |
| `enforce` | Returns sanitized + wrapped responses. Scripts, hidden elements, event handlers, and zero-width chars are stripped. |

Switch modes via environment variable:

```bash
export CLAUDE_SANITISER_MODE=enforce
```

Or in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "env": {
        "CLAUDE_SANITISER_MODE": "enforce"
    }
}
```

---

## Domain blocklist

Manually block domains from ever being fetched. Edit `~/.claude/web-blocklist.json`:

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "entries": [
        {
            "domain": "example-spam-site.com",
            "reason": "known prompt-injection host",
            "added_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
            "source": "user",
            "expires_at": null
        }
    ]
}
```

The hook reconciles this file with its SQLite database on every pre-hook invocation.

---

## Runtime files

Created automatically on first use:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/safe-web-research/state.db` | SQLite: sessions, blocklist, robots cache, fetch log |
| `~/.claude/safe-web-research/fetch-log.jsonl` | Every web fetch and its signals |
| `~/.claude/safe-web-research/hook-errors.log` | Hook crash log (should stay empty) |
| `~/.claude/web-blocklist.json` | Persistent domain blocklist |

---

## Drift analysis

Re-classify historical fetches against the current signal tier table:

```bash
~/.claude/bin/claude-sanitize replay --since=2026-01-01
```

Useful for seeing whether threshold changes would have changed any abort decisions.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Hooks not firing** — confirm `bun` is at `~/.bun/bin/bun` (`which bun`), that `~/.claude/settings.json` is valid JSON, and restart Claude Code after editing settings.

**`risk-tiers.json not found`** — confirm `~/.claude/skills/safe-web-research/risk-tiers.json` exists.

**`shell-quote` import error** — run `cd ~/.claude/hooks && bun install`.

**`<untrusted_source>` wrapper missing** — the hook failed silently. Check `~/.claude/safe-web-research/hook-errors.log`. Per the skill rules, treat unwrapped web content as a Critical abort signal.

**Bun not at `$HOME/.bun/bin/bun`** — find it with `which bun`, then update the `command` paths in `settings.json`.
